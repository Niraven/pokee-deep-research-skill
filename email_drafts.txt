1. INVISIBLE TECHNOLOGIES - AI Operations Associate (Score: 91/100)
================================================================================

To: careers@invisible.co
Subject: Application: AI Operations Associate - OpenClaw & AI Automation Experience

Hi Invisible Technologies Team,

I'm excited to apply for the AI Operations Associate position. Your Axon platform's approach to deploying AI agents that handle complex, multi-step workflows resonates deeply with my hands-on experience building OpenClaw — an AI automation system I've architected and operated.

Invisible's mission to compress "weeks of human work into minutes of AI-plus-human collaboration" mirrors exactly what I've been doing: creating AI infrastructure that actually works in production. Your 70% reduction in workflow processing time statistic tells me you value measurable impact — that's the mindset I bring.

Why me?
• Built and operate OpenClaw, an AI automation platform with MCP servers and real-world deployments
• Experience with Python, system administration, and DevOps workflows
• Based in the Philippines — aligned with your global, remote-first culture
• Comfortable with the "Atomic" philosophy: starting with current processes and gradually replacing manual steps with AI

I'd welcome the opportunity to bring my practical AI operations experience to your team and help scale your Meridial expert marketplace and Axon agent deployments.

Best regards,
Nino

2. COHERE - Software Engineer, AI Infrastructure (Junior) (Score: 91/100)
================================================================================

To: careers@cohere.com
Subject: Application: Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer - Philippines-Based AI Builder

Hi Cohere Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Junior Software Engineer - AI Infrastructure role. Cohere's focus on "powerful AI meets practical business solutions" aligns with my philosophy: AI should work in the real world, not just in demos.

Your North platform's promise of bringing everything together so "work just works" is compelling. I've experienced the pain of scattered AI tools firsthand while building OpenClaw — which is why I deeply appreciate Cohere's turnkey approach to enterprise AI.

What I bring:
• Production experience with AI systems (OpenClaw, MCP servers, automation workflows)
• Python expertise and Linux system administration background
• Understanding of distributed systems from managing my own infrastructure
• Security-conscious mindset — I value the multi-layered protection you emphasize

I'm particularly drawn to Cohere's VPC and on-premises deployment options. Having control over data and infrastructure is something I prioritize in my own work, and I'd love to help other enterprises achieve that same confidence.

Would love to discuss how my hands-on AI infrastructure experience could contribute to Cohere's mission.

Best regards,
Nino
