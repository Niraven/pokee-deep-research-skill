## Skills Checked for Updates

The following 7 clawdhub-managed skills were checked:

1. **flowmind** (v1.0.2) — local changes (no match)
2. **gmail** (v1.0.6) — local changes (no match)
3. **notion** (v1.0.0) — local changes (no match)
4. **mission-control** (v2.2.2) — local changes (no match)
5. **todoist-rs** (v1.0.1) — local changes (no match)
6. **cal-com** (v1.0.0) — local changes (no match)
7. **triple-memory-skill** (v1.0.0) — local changes (no match)

---

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** All managed skills have local modifications that prevent automatic updates.

**Error Message:** `local changes (no match). Use --force to overwrite.`

**Explanation:** The skills have been modified locally (likely customized SKILL.md files or other changes) and do not match the upstream versions. The `clawdhub update --all` command skips these to avoid overwriting local work.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Review Local Changes:** Check which skills have local modifications:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
   git status  # for skills that are git repos
   ```

2. **Force Update (if appropriate):** If local changes are not intentional:
   ```bash
   clawdhub update --all --force
   ```

3. **Selective Updates:** Update specific skills individually:
   ```bash
   clawdhub update <skill-name>
   ```

4. **Preserve Customizations:** If local changes are intentional:
   - Consider forking the skill
   - Or document changes in a separate file
